            <h3 class="subtitle"> Introduction</h3>
            <p> Hello, I'm Jokasta, and I'm on a remarkable journey of transformation from agriculture to the
                exciting world
                of technology. My journey is not just about a career change; it's a testament to my adaptability,
                resilience, and passion for learning. Allow me to share my story, the skills I've acquired along the
                way,
                and one of my unique hobbies that has shaped me.
            </p>

            <h3> Chapter 1: Cultivating Knowledge in Agriulture</h3>
            <p> My journey began with a degree in Agriculture, where I learned the art of nurturing crops and
                sustaining our
                world. For nearly five years, I delved deep into research and development within renowned
                institutions like
                MONSANTO, EMBRAPA, and IAPAR, where I honed skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and
                innovation.
                Agriculture was my first love, but I knew there was more I could explore.
            </p>

            <h3> Chapter 2: A Leap Across Continents</h3>
            <p> My quest for personal and professional growth led me to cross continents to the United Kingdom.
                Here, I
                embraced opportunities that broadened my horizons and expanded my skill set. From being a
                Receptionist to
                ensuring quality control in the pharmaceutical industry, every role contributed to my adaptability
                and the
                ability to thrive in diverse environments.
            </p>

            <h3> A Bold Transition to Technology</h3>
            <p> My next challenge was a career shift into technology. It's a world that captivated me with its
                limitless
                potential. I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, starting with a BootCamp at Firebrand to
                master
                Azure Cloud. The cloud became my canvas, and I was ready to paint my future.
            </p>

            <h3> Chapter 4: Building My Tech Foundation</h3>
            <p> Currently, I am studying at DIO, a boot camp sponsored by Santander, with the goal of becoming a
                full-stack
                developer. I'm learning languages like Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular and SQL, equipping
                myself with
                the tools to create digital solutions and web applications. My past experiences in research and
                quality
                control have become the foundation for my problem-solving skills in tech.
            </p>

            <h3> Chapter 5: Scaling New Heights in Life and Hobbies</h3>
            <p> Beyond my professional endeavors, I have a unique hobby that has shaped my characterâ€“climbing. Just
                as in my
                career, climbing teaches me perseverance, patience, and the importance of setting and achieving
                goals while
                reminds me that challenges are opportunities to grow and discover new heights, both in life and
                technology.
            </p>

            <h3> Passion and Goals</h3>
            <p> What fuels my journey is an unwavering passion for innovation. My transition into technology isn't
                just a
                change in career; it's a fusion of my agricultural roots, newfound tech skills, and the adventurous
                spirit I
                find in climbing. I'm on a mission to leverage technology to solve complex problems, create
                solutions, and
                embrace new challenges across industries, all while scaling new heights in both my career and my
                hobbies.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In summary, my journey from agriculture to tech is a testament to my determination and adaptability.
                It's
                about taking the knowledge and skills I cultivated in one field and using them as the seeds of
                transformation in another. I'm excited about what the future holds as I continue to evolve in this
                dynamic
                world of technology, blending the best of both worlds to create a brighter, more innovative future
                while
                scaling new heights in both my career and my hobbies.
